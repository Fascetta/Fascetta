## 🌟 Selected Projects

### [1. ResQu - Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion for Super-Resolution](https://github.com/Fascetta/ResQu)
- **Goal**: Introduced quaternion wavelets (Quave) as a structured prior in diffusion-based image super-resolution.
- **Impact**: Outperformed StableSR with a **+15% PSNR improvement** on complex visual textures.
- **Publication**: **IJCNN 2025 (Oral)** — [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00334)

### [2. Calibrating Neural Networks via Radius Regularization](https://github.com/Fascetta/CPHNN)
- **Goal**: Proposed a new radius-based regularizer to improve confidence calibration across geometries.
- **Impact**: Achieved **50% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**.
- **Status**: Under review (preprint available upon request).
