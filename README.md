### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of generative models, computer vision, and robotics.
Key areas of interest include:
- **Generative Computer Vision**: Exploring diffusion models, neural rendering, and 3D-aware synthesis for realistic and controllable content creation.
- **Embodied AI & Robotics**: Developing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that leverage generative priors for robust interaction and world understanding.
- **Efficient & Reliable AI**: Optimizing models for real-time performance and improving confidence calibration, particularly through novel geometric approaches.

## 🌟 Selected Publications & Projects

### [1. Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion for Super-Resolution](https://github.com/Fascetta/ResQu)
- **Publication**: IJCNN 2025 (Oral Presentation) — [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00334).
- **Contribution**: Developed a quaternion wavelet-conditioned diffusion model that achieved state-of-the-art results in image super-resolution, improving PSNR/SSIM by 2.4% over prior methods.


### [2. Calibrating Neural Networks via Radius Regularization](https://github.com/Fascetta/CPHNN)
- **Contribution**: As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I proposed a novel hyperbolic radius-based method for confidence calibration.
- **Impact**: Reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by **50% on CIFAR-100** and **33% on TinyImageNet**.

## 🎯 Career Goals & Future Work

I am preparing to pursue a **PhD in AI, Robotics, or Computer Vision**.

My long-term ambition is to contribute to a leading applied research lab to bridge the gap between foundational AI research and its application in creative media and interactive entertainment.
